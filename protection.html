			<h3 class="protection1">Standardization</h3>
			<p class="protection2">Hengshun Industry has almost formed a monopoly in the production of Zhenjiang vinegar. The company has been using the traditional process for more than 100 years. Adhering to the standardized quality control of the whole chain, Hengshun Industry examines each production link for strict quality inspection before entering the next production process, ensuring product safety and stable quality. Besides the standardized production model, the local government also establishes the “Zhenjiang Hengshun vinegar making technician center,” which employs retired old vinegar workers with skills and experience to teach and preserve the traditional production skills of hand-made vinegar.</p>

			<h3 class="protection3">Protection</h3>
			<p class="protection4"> The local government attaches great importance to the promotion and protection of vinegar. In 2008, the Vinegar Culture Museum was built in Zhenjiang, which is the first professional vinegar theme museum integrating cultural heritage protection, science education and industrial tourism. On July 29, 2016, the 24th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th People’s Congress of Jiangsu Province voted to adopt the Regulations on the Protection of Zhenjiang Balsamic Vinegar. Vinegar is written into the legal provisions for the production process, cultural heritage, intellectual property protection, industrial support and development, supervision and management, and legal responsibility.</p>

			<h3 class="protection5">Commercialization</h3>
			<p class="protection6">The commercialization of the vinegar is also successful enough. The brand value of Zhenjiang Vinegar has reached 45.892 billion RMB, ranking second in the national geographical indication protection products in China, spreading to 170 countries and regions, accounting for more than 60% of the total export of vinegar, and also selected as one of the top ten most popular Chinese goods by US netizens.</p>
